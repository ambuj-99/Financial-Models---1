Fama French Three-Factor Model, and the CAPM:
Beta Calculation and Regression Analysis: In this self-initiated project, the individual undertook a comprehensive analysis of Tesla's stock performance. They meticulously computed the stock's beta factor, a measure of its sensitivity to market fluctuations, by utilizing historical price data and market index performance. Employing regression analysis, they established a robust linear relationship between Tesla's stock returns and the market index, offering valuable insights into the stock's volatility and risk exposure.
Fama French Three-Factor Model Integration: Going beyond traditional methods, the project delved into the application of the Fama French Three-Factor Model. By considering not only market risk but also factors like size and value, the individual crafted a more nuanced model to evaluate Tesla's stock price movements. The incorporation of these additional dimensions led to a more comprehensive understanding of the stock's performance drivers and allowed for more accurate price predictions.
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) Implementation: The project further extended its analysis by implementing the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), a fundamental tool in finance. By factoring in the risk-free rate and Tesla's beta, the individual quantified the expected return of the stock. This strategic approach provided a valuable framework to estimate the stock's potential performance in relation to its risk level, empowering informed investment decisions and offering a holistic view of Tesla's market dynamics.
